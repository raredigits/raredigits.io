## Yes, We Use Cookies

This is where we're legally obligated to tell you about those little digital breadcrumbs called "cookies" that follow you around the internet. But instead of drowning you in legalese that nobody reads, let's have an honest conversation.

## What's Really Going On Here

We use Google Analytics on our website. There, we said it! These third-party scripts help us understand how you interact with our site—which pages you visit, how long you stay, and whether you're accessing us from your phone while sitting on the toilet (the data is anonymized, but we know it happens).

## Why This Actually Matters

Without these analytics tools, we'd be like blind kittens stumbling around the internet—cute, but completely clueless. These cookies are the flashlights that help us see:

- Which parts of our website you actually care about
- Where you get confused and leave
- How we can make your experience better

The entire online business ecosystem runs on this information. When we know what works and what doesn't, we can build better products, create more relevant content, and stop wasting your time with things you don't care about.

## Your Options 

Because We Legally Have to Give You Some:
1. **Accept the cookies:** Continue using our site normally, and help us improve it.
2. **Decline the cookies:** You can adjust your browser settings to reject cookies, though this might affect your experience.
3. **Clear cookies periodically:** You can always clear your browsing data if you're feeling digital-crumb-phobic.

## The Serious Legal Bit

By using our website, you acknowledge that we employ Google Analytics and similar third-party tools to collect anonymous usage data. This data collection complies with applicable privacy regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection laws. Google processes this information according to their own privacy policy, which you can review [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

We do not sell your personal information, because honestly, we don't collect enough of it to make it worth selling.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about our privacy practices that weren't answered by this refreshingly straightforward policy, please contact us at [legal@raredigits.io](mailto:legal@raredigits.io).
