## Yes, We Use Cookies

This is where we’re legally obligated to tell you about those little digital breadcrumbs called “cookies” that follow you around the internet. But instead of drowning you in legalese that nobody reads, let’s have an honest conversation.

## What’s Really Going On Here

We use Google Analytics on our website. There, we said it! These third-party scripts help us understand how you interact with our site, including which pages you visit, how long you stay, and what kind of device you’re using. The data is anonymized and used only in aggregate form.

## Why This Actually Matters

Without these analytics tools, we’d be like blind kittens stumbling around the internet—cute, but completely clueless. These cookies are the flashlights that help us see:

- Which parts of our website you actually care about
- Where you get confused and leave
- How we can make your experience better

The entire online business ecosystem runs on this information. When we know what works and what doesn’t, we can build better products, create more relevant content, and stop wasting your time with things you don’t care about.

## Your Options

Because we legally have to give you some:

1. **Accept the cookies:** Continue using our site normally, and help us improve it.
2. **Decline the cookies:** You can adjust your browser settings to reject cookies, though this might affect your experience.
3. **Clear cookies periodically** (withdraw your consent): You can always clear your browsing data if you’re feeling digital-crumb-phobic.

## The Serious Legal Bit

This Privacy Policy is an integral part of our [Terms of Use](/legal/terms/) and applies to all visitors of this website. It explains what data is collected, how it is used, and what that means for you.

We use Google Analytics as an analytics tool to better understand how our website is used. We only receive aggregated and anonymized usage statistics, such as page views, session duration, and general device or browser categories. We do not receive data that directly identifies individual users.

Google Analytics may collect additional information as part of its standard operation. Details of what Google collects and how it processes data are governed by Google’s own [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Google is expected to comply with applicable data protection regulations, including GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, CPRA, and similar frameworks. At the very least, from a legal standpoint.

If you are not confident that using this website complies with GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, CPRA, or any other local privacy regulations applicable to you, you should immediately discontinue use of this website.

We do not sell your personal information, because honestly, we don’t collect enough of it to make it worth selling.

## Questions?
