# The "We're All Adults Here" Agreement

Welcome to the part of our website where we explain the rules of our digital playground.

## Our Website: A Work in Progress

Like that home renovation project you started three years ago, our website is perpetually "almost done." Here's what that means for you:

- **We update things:** Sometimes randomly, sometimes with purpose. We might add new features, remove ones nobody uses, or completely redesign everything because someone on our team read a design blog.

- **No advance warning:** While we'd love to send you a personalized notification before each update, that's not happening. Changes may occur at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all—just like your cat's sudden sprints across the house at 3 AM.

- **Content changes:** Information, offers, and services described on our site may change faster than fashion trends. What was true yesterday might not be true today. It's not that we're being deceptive—we're just keeping things fresh and responding to the chaotic nature of existence.

## Stability: More of a Suggestion Than a Guarantee

We strive for 99.9% uptime, but sometimes computers do what computers do—they crash, freeze, or decide to install updates at the most inconvenient moments. 

We cannot and do not guarantee that:

- Our service will be available 24/7/365
- All features will work perfectly every time
- The site will load faster than your patience expires
- Gremlins won't occasionally invade our servers

While we do our best to keep everything running smoothly, technical issues, maintenance, or the occasional digital apocalypse might interrupt your access to our site. During these moments, we suggest trying ancient coping techniques like "reading a book" or "talking to another human."

## The "Not Our Fault" Clause

By using our website, you acknowledge that:

1. **You're using it at your own risk:** Think of our website like that sketchy shortcut through the woods—it probably works fine, but we're not responsible if you encounter digital wolves.

2. **We're not liable for damages:** Whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential—if something goes wrong and you lose data, profits, or that winning lottery ticket number you stored in our app, we sympathize but cannot be held responsible.

3. **Decision-making is on you:** Any decisions you make based on information from our site are your responsibility. If our article about investment tips doesn't make you a millionaire, or our recipe for chocolate cake somehow ruins your kitchen, that's on you (though we'd love to hear what went wrong with the cake).

4. **Links to other websites:** We sometimes point you to other corners of the internet. When you leave our site, you're no longer under our digital umbrella of protection. It's like we introduced you to someone at a party—we can't control what happens after that introduction.

## Legal Stuff We Actually Need to Say

Despite our casual tone, this is a legally binding agreement. By using our website, you're agreeing to these terms in their entirety. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you should stop using our website immediately (though we'd be sad to see you go).

These terms may change without notice, so check back occasionally if you're the type who enjoys reading terms of service for fun.

## Questions?

If you have questions about these terms that weren't answered by this refreshingly honest agreement, please contact us at [legal@raredigits.io](mailto:legal@raredigits.io).
