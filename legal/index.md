## Simple Strategy: Just Don't Break the Law

We respect lawyers but prefer not to give them reasons to send us invoices. To achieve this, we employ an ingenious lifehack in all our operations — we aim to comply with applicable laws and honor the commitments we make.

## Let's Talk Before You Sue

If you ever feel the need to discuss legal matters with us, we always suggest resolving everything pre-trial. It’s consistently more beneficial, cost-effective, and faster for everyone involved.

## UAE-Based, Globally Minded

Just as a friendly reminder, we’re legally established in the UAE and comply with all local regulations. If you believe we’ve somehow failed to meet your local legal expectations — please let us know. [Have a cookie instead](/legal/privacy) 🍪
