# Partnership
One of the great ironies of business is that everyone talks about getting to the top, but almost no one wants to discuss what's at the bottom. This is odd because, as it turns out, the bottom parts tend to be quite important. Burj Khalifa would be considerably less impressive if its first few floors were made of papier-mâché and optimistic thinking, right?

## Building Pyramid
A curious thing about financial leverage is that everyone talks about it like it's potentially dangerous, yet everyone uses it anyway. Banks are essentially leverage machines. Venture capitalists enthusiastically apply it. Even your mortgage is just leverage wearing casual Friday clothes.

The same principle applies to sales. You could theoretically sell everything yourself, one conversation at a time, like a financial advisor explaining diversification to each client individually. Or you could do what actually works: build a growing network of professional agents who can explain your product while you sleep, which is the sales equivalent of making your leverage work for you.

## Referal Program
Referrals follow similar mathematics. There's an old saying that "the giving hand will not become empty," which sounds like mystical wisdom but is actually just good business arithmetic. When you share profits with people who bring you customers, everyone's balance sheet tends to improve. Strange how that works: revolutionary in theory, effective in practice.

The fine print (which isn't actually fine or printed): our referral attribution never expires. Each transaction permanently maintains its referral connection—a concept surprisingly rare in an industry where relationships typically have more expiration dates than yogurt.

Think of it as perpetual equity in every deal you facilitate. 

No clawbacks, no quarterly reassessments, no "upon further review" emails from accounting.

## Call to Action
If you happen to know someone for whom our products might solve actual problems—perhaps a friend who mentions those problems over drinks, or a colleague who sighs heavily during relevant meetings—consider [letting us know](mailto:hi@raredigits.io). We'll provide you with whatever tools you need to make the introduction successful, plus the referral compensation that makes capitalism function properly.

Selling complex IT products that save money is actually easier than explaining to your spouse why you bought that expensive exercise equipment that now serves primarily as a clothes rack.

After all, spotting opportunities where others don't is essentially the definition of alpha. Why leave it on the table?
