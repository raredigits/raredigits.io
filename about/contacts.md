# Get in Touch

Welcome to our virtual reception. We promise our response times are faster than light (in a vacuum of bureaucracy).

## Headquarters
Our mothership is docked in Dubai. For official correspondence (love letters, wedding invitations, quantum physics debates), please use:


> Rare Digits Production DMCC
DMCC Business Centre,
Jewellery & Gemplex 3,
115738, Dubai, UAE

## Personal Encounters of the Third Kind

Wish to witness our elegance and brutality in person? Our ambassadors of innovation are strategically placed around the globe, much like a very sophisticated game of Risk:

- Dubai (Home Base)
- Berlin (Bratwurst and Bytecode)
- Copenhagen (Danish and Databases)
- Jakarta (Java Central, pun intended)
- Bali (Beach Coding Retreats)
- Tbilisi (Wine and Web Services)
- Limassol (Mediterranean Microservices)
- Porto (Port and Python)
- Miami (Sunscreen and Scalability)
- Phuket (Thai and TypeScript)

Choose your preferred locale, and we'll arrange a meeting faster than you can say "asynchronous non-blocking I/O".

## Beam Me Up, Scotty

Not a fan of geographical constraints? Our demo booking form transcends space and time. Well, mostly time zones.

Remember, whether you're reaching out from the bustling streets of Tokyo or the quiet corners of Timbuktu, we're just a quantum entanglement away. 

Let's make software magic together. Or at least have a chat about how we can automate your coffee machine to brew the perfect cup based on your circadian rhythms and current project deadlines.
