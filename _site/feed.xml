<p>Starting August 4th through September 8th, the entire Rare Digits Production team will be doing that thing humans supposedly do when they’re not staring at screens—relaxing, allegedly.

<p>Now, you might wonder: “What about all our urgent requests and burning questions about data visualization philosophy?” Great question. Here’s where it gets interesting: our technical support will continue operating in normal mode, because apparently some people drew the short straw in the vacation lottery.

<p>This creates a fascinating corporate paradox: a company that’s simultaneously closed and open, like Schrödinger’s business entity. Our support team will handle your technical issues with the same efficiency as always, while the rest of us practice the ancient art of “logging off.”</p>

<p>Why announce this? Because transparency is good, and also because we learned that people get really upset when their emails bounce back with mysterious auto-replies. Who knew?</p>

<p>We’ll be back September 8th, presumably well-rested and with renewed enthusiasm for turning data chaos into decision clarity. Or at least with better tans.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Dubai, 09/04/2025</em> — In what can only be described as “finally,” the company today announced <a href="/tools/jeeves/">Jeeves GPT</a>, an AI-powered business intelligence platform that lets C-suite executives ask their ERP systems questions in actual human language instead of whatever ritualistic incantations they were using before.</p>

<p>The new system officially replaces the now-deceased Concierge App, which apparently had about as much conversational ability as a particularly stubborn spreadsheet. Jeeves GPT, powered by the latest large language models (because of course it is), promises to transform the age-old executive tradition of asking “What were our Q3 numbers again?” into something slightly less painful for everyone involved.</p>

<p>“We watched executives spend hours hunting for information that was literally sitting in their systems, ” said Rare’s business analitycs, probably while gesturing dramatically at a Excel table nobody understands. “It’s 2025. Your phone can compose poetry about your lunch, but getting a simple revenue breakdown still required sending emails to Gary in Finance and waiting three business days.”</p>

<h2 id="the-rise-and-fall-ofspreadsheet-culture">The Rise and Fall of Spreadsheet Culture</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest: spreadsheets are where good data goes to die. Sure, they look impressive with all those colorful charts and real-time widgets, but when was the last time anyone actually <em>used</em> one to make a decision? Mostly they just sit there looking busy while executives ask their assistants to “please get someone to pull the actual numbers.”</p>

<p>Jeeves GPT takes a different approach:</p>

<div class="highlight">It lets you ask questions like a normal human being. </div>

<p>Want to know if your new sales team is worth the ridiculous salaries you’re paying them? Just ask. Curious about whether that supply chain “disruption” everyone keeps mentioning is actually affecting your business? Jeeves has opinions, and more importantly, data to back them up.</p>

<p>The system gets particularly chatty when integrated with the company’s other products, Atlas ERP and Corsair HQ.</p>

<h2 id="aithat-actually-learns-revolutionary-weknow">AI That Actually Learns (Revolutionary, We Know)</h2>

<p>Here’s where things get interesting: Jeeves GPT doesn’t just regurgitate pre-programmed responses like some kind of overpriced Magic 8-Ball. It actually learns from how your company works, what questions you ask, and probably what you had for breakfast (okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea).</p>

<p>“The old Concierge App was like having a very polite but pretty limited assistant, ” explained Dmitry Schnellreich, the COO of Rare Digits, presumably while suppressing traumatic memories of user training sessions. “Jeeves GPT is more like having a very smart, slightly sarcastic analyst who never sleeps and doesn’t judge you for asking the same question three different ways.”</p>

<p>The learning aspect means the system gets better at understanding your specific brand of corporate chaos. It picks up on industry jargon, learns which metrics actually matter to your business (as opposed to the seventeen KPIs someone insisted on tracking), and starts anticipating the follow-up questions you’re inevitably going to ask.</p>

<h2 id="the-board-meeting-revolution">The Board Meeting Revolution</h2>

<p>Early users report that Jeeves GPT has fundamentally altered the pre-board meeting panic ritual. You know the one: frantic emails, last-minute PowerPoint edits, and that special kind of anxiety that comes from knowing someone’s definitely going to ask about something you forgot to check.</p>

<p>Now, apparently, executives can just casually ask their AI buddy for a competitive analysis while walking to the conference room. Revolutionary? Maybe. Slightly terrifying for anyone whose job involved manually compiling those reports? Definitely.</p>

<p>“I used to spend entire afternoons preparing for investor calls,” said one early adopter who clearly has better things to do with their time. “Now I just ask Jeeves for a rundown while I’m getting my coffee. It’s honestly a little unsettling how good it is.”</p>

<h2 id="the-future-isconversational-and-probably-judging-your-decisions">The Future Is Conversational (And Probably Judging Your Decisions)</h2>

<p>Rare Digits promises that Jeeves GPT will keep getting smarter as AI technology advances, which means your business intelligence is basically investing in its own education. Whether that’s reassuring or vaguely dystopian depends on your relationship with technology and/or science fiction movies.</p>

<p>What’s clear is that the era of hunting through endless dashboards and waiting for analysts to compile reports is officially over. Whether that’s progress or just another way to make everyone’s job slightly more complicated remains to be seen, but at least now you can get your quarterly numbers without having to remember which tab has the “real” revenue data.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a mountain of data. Tons of it. Great.  <br />
AI churns out terabytes of content. Wow.  <br />
Everything sorted into endless tabs. Amazing.  <br />
But wait. What’s the point?</p>

<p>Just kidding. We’re actually thrilled, but for different reasons.</p>

<p>After 20 years of watching businesses drown in meaningless dashboards and screaming metrics, we finally decided to do something about it. Meet <a href="/tools/open-source/styles/">Rare Styles</a>—a design system for those who are tired of information noise.</p>

<p>“Revolutionary approach to data visualization!” you’ll say. And you’d be right, but not in the way these words are usually thrown around. Our revolution is about refusal. <strong>In the age of excess, refusal becomes revolution.</strong></p>

<p>What we’ve done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Packed 20 years of experience into one component library</li>
  <li>Threw out everything that doesn’t help make decisions</li>
  <li>Created the Digital Rareism philosophy (yes, we’re cocky enough to call it philosophy)</li>
  <li>Made it all open source because good ideas should multiply</li>
</ul>

<p>“But we already have Bootstrap/Material/whatever!” we’ll hear. Perfect. Keep drowning in decorative clutter. We’re taking a different path—only the rare survives.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-money-across-the-web3-wilderness">Follow the Money Across the Web3 Wilderness</h2>

<p>Rare Digits has just launched Watchtower, our new application that monitors liquidity movements between Web3 networks. Think of it as a financial traffic helicopter reporting on capital flows across the increasingly congested blockchain highway system.</p>

<div class="Space"><div class="construction-notice">

<h2 id="what-it-does">What It Does</h2>

<p>Watchtower tracks capital movements across blockchain networks, providing developers and investors with real-time intelligence on where the money’s going. Because in the world of Web3, following the liquidity is like tracking migrating wildebeests—it tells you where the ecosystem is heading next.</p>

<h2 id="who-its-for">Who It’s For</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Developers</strong>: Who need to know which ecosystems are gaining traction</li>
  <li><strong>Investors</strong>: Looking to spot capital flow trends before they become obvious</li>
  <li><strong>Anyone</strong>: Who enjoys watching money move around while pretending to work</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="current-capabilities">Current Capabilities</h2>

<p>The first version supports EVM-compatible networks and Cosmos SDK chains—covering most of the territories where digital money does its nomadic wandering. Like any respectable financial surveillance tool, Watchtower plans to expand its jurisdiction in future updates.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>In traditional finance, capital flows are obscured by private banking systems and offshore structures designed by people who consider sunlight a regulatory burden. In Web3, all transactions are public—but scattered across dozens of networks with different standards and interfaces.</p>

<p>Watchtower brings clarity to this chaos. Because making informed decisions requires actual information, not just Discord rumors and Twitter speculation.</p>

<p>If consultants have told you “it depends,” they’re not being evasive—they’re being honest. But “it depends” without explaining what it depends on is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p>

<div class="full-width">
  <img src="/assets/img/newsroom/2025/big_check.jpg" />
</div>

<h2 id="the-real-deciding-factor-your-business-capacity">The Real Deciding Factor: Your Business Capacity</h2>

<p>The answer to this client strategy question isn’t found in generic best practices or industry benchmarks. It lives in the honest assessment of your business capacity and scalability.</p>

<h2 id="the-whale-strategy-big-checks-big-stakes">The Whale Strategy: Big Checks, Big Stakes</h2>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lower client acquisition costs (convince one client instead of fifty)</li>
  <li>Streamlined operations (serve fewer masters)</li>
  <li>Potentially higher prestige and stronger case studies</li>
  <li>Fewer invoices to chase and relationships to manage</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Capacity Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Can your business survive if 1-2 clients have payment delays?</li>
  <li>Do you have the operational depth to handle a major client crisis?</li>
  <li>What happens if your key relationship manager quits mid-project?</li>
  <li>Can your cash flow handle the feast-or-famine payment cycles?</li>
</ul>

<p>The whale strategy works beautifully when your business has financial reserves to weather gaps between large payments and enough organizational redundancy to prevent any single employee’s departure from threatening client relationships.</p>

<h2 id="the-minnow-strategy-volume-and-consistency">The Minnow Strategy: Volume and Consistency</h2>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>More predictable revenue streams</li>
  <li>Lower catastrophic risk if any single client leaves</li>
  <li>Broader market feedback on your offerings</li>
  <li>Higher valuation multiples (investors love diversified revenue)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Capacity Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Can your support systems scale to handle hundreds of clients?</li>
  <li>Does your onboarding process work without white-glove treatment?</li>
  <li>Will your margins survive when support costs multiply?</li>
  <li>Can you automate enough to prevent administrative collapse?</li>
</ul>

<p>The minnow strategy thrives when your business has highly systematized operations, exceptional automation, and the ability to scale support without linearly increasing costs.</p>

<h2 id="the-existential-capacity-question">The Existential Capacity Question</h2>

<p>The fundamental question isn’t which client type is “better”—it’s whether your business is built to handle the specific challenges each type presents.</p>

<p>A boutique creative agency with six employees pursuing enterprise clients without financial reserves is a heart attack waiting to happen. A SaaS platform pursuing small businesses without automated support systems is preparing to drown in tickets.</p>

<h2 id="the-risk-spectrum">The Risk Spectrum</h2>

<p>Every business exists somewhere on this risk spectrum:</p>

<p><strong>Whale Dependency</strong> → <strong>Balanced Portfolio</strong> → <strong>Support Overwhelm</strong></p>

<p>Moving left risks catastrophic client loss. Moving right risks operational collapse. The sweet spot depends entirely on your capacity to handle each type of risk.</p>

<h2 id="your-practical-next-steps">Your Practical Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Audit your operational breaking points:</strong> What would break first if you doubled your client count? What would break first if your largest client doubled their demands?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Calculate your true client servicing costs:</strong> Many businesses discover their “best” clients are actually unprofitable when all service costs are properly allocated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Map your cash runway against client concentration:</strong> How many months could you operate if your largest client disappeared? If the answer makes you nervous, diversification isn’t optional.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assess your automation maturity:</strong> If your business requires high-touch human intervention for routine client needs, the minnow strategy will crush your margins.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-uncomfortable-truth">The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>

<p>The clients you should prioritize are the ones your business is actually built to serve profitably. This may not match your aspirations or industry norms, but it will match financial reality.</p>

<p>If your business lacks the capacity reserves to handle whale-sized client demands or the operational efficiency to service a minnow school profitably, the solution isn’t a different client strategy—it’s a fundamental business redesign.</p>

<p>The best client mix isn’t the one that sounds most impressive at industry conferences. It’s the one that allows you to sleep at night while your bank account grows.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Insights" /><category term="business" /><category term="core" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The eternal business question: should you court the whale clients who write enormous checks twice a year, or cultivate a school of minnows who pay smaller amounts but with clockwork regularity?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Lending Assessment Practices Can Revolutionize Auto Repair Shop’s Cash Flow</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Lending-Scoring-Practice/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Lending Assessment Practices Can Revolutionize Auto Repair Shop’s Cash Flow" /><published>2025-01-13T10:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2025-01-13T10:00:00+04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Lending-Scoring-Practice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Lending-Scoring-Practice/"><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered why banks sleep soundly while your auto repair shop suffers from payment anxiety? Simple: they’ve mastered the dark art of predicting who will actually pay.</p>

<p>Good news—you can steal their techniques.</p>

<div class="full-width">

</div>
<p><cite>“Is this even going to be paid for?”</cite></p>

<h2 id="the-problem-schrödingers-payment">The Problem: Schrödinger’s Payment</h2>

<p>You’ve got six vehicles in your service bay. Parts ordered, labor scheduled, but the critical question remains: will all these customers pay promptly when the work is done? Until they do, each invoice exists in a quantum state of both “definitely getting paid” and “absolutely hopeless.”</p>

<p>This uncertainty isn’t just annoying—it’s financially dangerous. It leads to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash flow forecasts with the accuracy of a carnival fortune teller</li>
  <li>Inventory decisions based on hope rather than data</li>
  <li>Stress levels that would concern medical professionals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="banking-wisdom-for-grease-monkeys">Banking Wisdom for Grease Monkeys</h2>

<p>Lenders have solved this problem through systematic risk assessment. Here’s how to adapt their approach for your repair shop:</p>

<h3 id="1-basic-payment-history-scoring">1. Basic Payment History Scoring</h3>

<p>Start simple: create a three-tier classification system for existing customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Green</strong>: Pays promptly, never disputes charges (your financial angels)</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow</strong>: Pays eventually, sometimes negotiates after work is done</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong>: History of disputes, delayed payments, or mysterious disappearances</li>
</ul>

<p>For new customers, begin with yellow and adjust based on behavior.</p>

<h3 id="2-pre-work-qualification">2. Pre-Work Qualification</h3>

<p>Before significant repairs, implement these lending-inspired techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deposit requirements</strong>: Scale based on job size and customer history</li>
  <li><strong>Credit card pre-authorization</strong>: The automotive equivalent of a credit check</li>
  <li><strong>Payment plan documentation</strong>: For larger repairs, establish terms before work begins</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-external-signals-assessment">3. External Signals Assessment</h3>

<p>Banks look beyond direct history. You can too:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vehicle value vs. repair cost ratio</strong>: If the repair exceeds 60% of vehicle value, payment risk increases dramatically</li>
  <li><strong>Customer stability indicators</strong>: Local homeowners with steady jobs are statistically more likely to pay than temporary residents</li>
  <li><strong>Communication patterns</strong>: Customers who are difficult to reach or vague about details represent higher risk</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation-a-simple-scoring-system">Implementation: A Simple Scoring System</h2>

<p>Create a basic 10-point system where customers start at 5 points. Add or subtract based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prior payment history (+3/-3)</li>
  <li>Deposit provided (+2)</li>
  <li>Repair-to-vehicle value ratio (-1 for every 20% above 50%)</li>
  <li>Local property owner (+1)</li>
  <li>Communication clarity (+1/-1)</li>
</ul>

<p>8-10 points = Green (96% payment probability)
5-7 points = Yellow (82% payment probability)
1-4 points = Red (60% payment probability)</p>

<h2 id="strategic-responses-to-scores">Strategic Responses to Scores</h2>

<p>Different risk levels require different approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Green</strong>: Standard payment terms, priority scheduling</li>
  <li><strong>Yellow</strong>: Deposits required, clear payment terms documentation</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong>: Higher deposits, phased approval for work, pre-authorized payments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-financial-impact">The Financial Impact</h2>

<p>By implementing even a basic version of this system, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Predict cash flow with significantly improved accuracy</li>
  <li>Make informed inventory and staffing decisions</li>
  <li>Identify which jobs actually contribute to profitability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Banks don’t extend credit based on good feelings or optimism—they use systems. Your auto shop deserves the same protection. Because while fixing engines might be your passion, getting paid should be a certainty.</p>

<p>Remember: hope is not a financial strategy. Systematic payment prediction is.</p>

</div>

<p>In what financial analysts are calling “the least unnecessary software launch of the decade,” Rare Digits has released <a href="/tools/corsair/">Corsair HQ</a>, a revolutionary executive intelligence platform designed for business leaders who are tired of pretending they understand their own company’s reports.</p>

<h2 id="when-every-department-is-profitable-but-the-company-isnt">When Every Department Is Profitable But The Company Isn’t</h2>

<p>Corsair HQ addresses the fundamental paradox of modern business: how seventeen browser tabs of “business intelligence” can result in precisely zero actual intelligence about your business. The platform integrates with your existing ERP, CRM, and accounting systems to provide what executives have secretly wanted all along—a single screen that actually answers the question “how is my business doing?” without requiring an advanced degree in creative data interpretation.</p>

<p>“We noticed executives spending more time reconciling contradictory reports than making actual decisions,” said the Rare Digits product team. “Corsair HQ is our solution to the problem of having more data but less clarity, more systems but fewer answers.”</p>

<h2 id="the-executive-dashboard-that-requires-just-one-eye">The Executive Dashboard That Requires Just One Eye</h2>

<p>Unlike traditional business intelligence tools that promise “360-degree visibility” while delivering 360 different metrics that don’t connect to each other, Corsair HQ takes a refreshingly subversive approach. The platform filters the data tsunami down to what actually matters, connects information that should have been connected all along, and highlights problems before they become financial cardiac events.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/illustrations/products/corsair/corsair-mobile-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Business leaders will be relieved to know that Corsair HQ works seamlessly with all major cloud solutions. This means you won’t have to explain to your board why the systems you’ve already invested millions in were poorly chosen. Your teams keep using their familiar tools, you gain unprecedented clarity, and everyone maintains the fiction that all previous technology decisions were sound.</p>

<p>Early adopters report a 73% reduction in “staring blankly at conflicting spreadsheets” and an 86% decrease in “pretending to understand what these numbers mean.”</p>

<h2 id="available-now-for-businesses-ready-for-actual-clarity">Available Now For Businesses Ready For Actual Clarity</h2>

<p>Corsair HQ is available immediately for businesses that have grown tired of the “throw more dashboards at the problem” approach to financial visibility. For more information or to schedule a demonstration where we show you what your business is actually doing rather than what your department heads say it’s doing, contact the Rare Digits team today.</p>

<p>Remember: in the world of business intelligence, the ability to see clearly with one eye is worth more than being blind with two.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Release" /><category term="kitchen" /><category term="erp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pardon Our Digital Dust</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Reconstruction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pardon Our Digital Dust" /><published>2024-09-02T10:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T10:00:00+04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Reconstruction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/newsroom/Reconstruction/"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes the best investments require a little temporary inconvenience.

</div>

<p>The website is currently undergoing maintenance and upgrades. Some features might be temporarily unavailable or behave like a cryptocurrency — there one minute, gone the next. The digital contractors are working diligently behind the scaffolding of code and design.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can see this:</p>

<div class="Space"><div class="construction-notice">
    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 2em">🚧</span>
    </p>
    <p><strong>SECTION ON RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="material-icons" style="font-size: 2em">construction</span>
    </p>
</div></div>

<p>Thats just temporary, no worries.</p>

<h2 id="business-as-usual">Business as Usual?</h2>
<p>Rest assured that business operations continue as usual. The algorithms are still calculating, the servers are still serving, and your money is still being counted with the same precision that made you choose this service in the first place. Think of it as the financial equivalent of changing the tires while the car is still moving — slightly nerve-wracking but ultimately impressive.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-itbeready">When Will It Be Ready?</h2>
<p>When will everything be back to normal? As soon as possible. Technology renovations follow their own mysterious timeline, like venture capital funding rounds or quarterly earnings calls. But unlike those, this one is being expedited with genuine urgency.</p>

<h2 id="need-toreach-us">Need to Reach Us?</h2>
<p>For urgent matters or partnership inquiries, the <a href="/about/contacts">concierge service</a> remains fully operational and ready to assist. They’re the equivalent of that one stable asset in a volatile market — dependable when everything else seems in flux.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you need anything. We’re always here, even if our website is temporarily playing dress-up.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding and patience during this upgrade. After all, if financial markets can recover from temporary disruptions, so can websites — usually with better returns on investment.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Internal Affairs" /><category term="kitchen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes the best investments require a little temporary inconvenience.

<p>We’re excited to announce that Rare Digits has formed a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.destination-future.com">Destination Future</a>, the multi-national technology provider operating across three countries and specializing in Smart Networks, High-Performance Computing, Automation, and IoT solutions.</p>

<div class="full-width">
  <img src="/assets/img/newsroom/2024/destination.jpg" />
</div>

<h2 id="from-data-to-destiny">From Data to Destiny</h2>

<p>In this groundbreaking collaboration, Destination Future will implement Rare Digits’ management solutions across their entire technology ecosystem. Our “Data In, Meaning Out” approach will now be powering the decision-making behind networks that connect people, computers that crunch impossible numbers, and machines that automate tomorrow’s world.</p>

<h2 id="are-we-managing-the-future">Are We Managing the Future?</h2>

<p>Well, technically—yes.</p>

<p>When our dashboards are monitoring the performance of Destination Future’s smart networks, when our ERP system is allocating resources for their high-performance computing clusters, and when our analytics are optimizing their IoT deployments… we’re quite literally providing the intelligence that drives tomorrow’s infrastructure.</p>

<p>Is that the same as having a crystal ball? Not quite. But it’s certainly the next best thing.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means</h2>

<p>For Destination Future, this partnership means gaining crystal-clear visibility into their complex technology landscape, enabling faster, more confident decision-making across their three-country operation.</p>

<p>For Rare Digits, it means our solutions are now woven into the fabric of technologies that are actively shaping what comes next.</p>

<p>For everyone else, it means one more reason to watch this space—because when companies that build the future partner with companies that make sense of data, interesting things tend to happen.</p>

<h2 id="pure-performance-meets-future-performance">Pure Performance Meets Future Performance</h2>

<p>This partnership perfectly embodies our “Pure Performance, No Excess” philosophy. Destination Future doesn’t need more data—they generate enough to fill digital oceans. What they need is meaning, clarity, and actionable intelligence without the fluff.</p>

<p>And that’s exactly what we deliver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: While we’re technically managing systems that shape the future, Rare Digits cannot be held responsible for paradoxes, timeline disruptions, or butterfly effects. We’re working on a dashboard for those too, but it’s still in beta.</p>
