## Support Shouldn't Be Necessary

Let's start with a controversial opinion: if your software constantly requires support and endless explanations, there's something fundamentally wrong with the product.

At Rare Digits, we build solutions that work intuitively, present data clearly, and function reliably. Our dashboards don't need instruction manuals, and our systems don't require constant hand-holding.

But we're also realists. Sometimes you need something specific. Sometimes edge cases happen. And yes, occasionally things break. That's why we've created a support approach that's as straightforward as our software.

## No AI Chatbots or Support Tier Mazes

When you need help, you don't want to:
- Chat with an AI pretending to be human
- Explain your issue to a junior representative who needs to "escalate" everything
- Navigate through support tiers designed to wear you down
- Wait days for someone who actually understands the system

Our radical approach? 

<div class="highlight">When you contact support, you connect directly with our technical directors—the same people who oversee the development of our solutions. They understand the problem because they built them.</div>

## Technical Directors as Your First Line of Support

Yes, you read that correctly. Your support requests go straight to our technical leadership. Why?

- They can immediately understand what you're asking for
- They have the authority to prioritize new data views or reports
- They can implement fixes without needing approval chains
- They recognize patterns that might indicate larger issues
- They bring your feedback directly into the product development cycle

This approach isn't scalable in the conventional support model. It's not meant to be. It's designed to be effective, not to handle thousands of tickets about basic functionality that should just work.

## System Outages? That's On Us

If your system isn't working, our support is completely free. Full stop.

We don't charge you for fixing problems that shouldn't exist in the first place. Our business model depends on creating reliable systems that deliver value, not on collecting support fees when those systems fail.

This policy does more than save you money—it aligns our incentives perfectly with yours. We are motivated to build rock-solid systems that rarely need emergency support because every outage costs us both time and money.

## How Our Support Actually Works

1. **Direct contact:** You reach out through your dedicated channel
2. **Technical response:** A technical director reviews your request immediately
3. **Solution implementation:** Rather than explaining why something can't be done, we focus on implementing what you need
4. **Feedback loop:** Your request informs our product development, improving the system for everyone

At Rare Digits, we believe the best support experience is the one you rarely need to use. But when you do need it, it should connect you directly with the people who can actually solve your problem.
