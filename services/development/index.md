# Custom Development

## When You Need Something That Doesn't Exist Yet

Sometimes, the perfect solution for your business problem simply doesn't exist in the market. No amount of searching, comparing feature lists, or sitting through demos will help, because what you need hasn't been built yet.

That's when we roll up our sleeves and build it ourselves.

## Custom Development Without the Custom Timeline

Custom software development often falls victim to overengineering—building complex architectures and flexibility that you'll never actually use. It's like commissioning a custom Swiss Army knife with 200 tools when you really just need a good hammer.

This all points to an industry dirty secret: custom projects are notorious for running over time, over budget, and under expectations. Clients enter with optimism and exit with battle scars, wondering how a "six-month project" turned into a two-year odyssey.

We refuse to play that game. Our development approach follows the “No Overengineering” principle and a strict “three-sprint rule”:

1. **Sprint 1: Requirements & Design** (3 weeks)
   - Defining exactly what we're building and why
   - Mapping data flows and integration points
   - Creating detailed specifications and acceptance criteria

2. **Sprint 2: Development** (3 weeks)
   - Building the core functionality
   - Implementing integrations with existing systems
   - Daily progress updates and course corrections

3. **Sprint 3: Testing & Refinement** (3 weeks)
   - Rigorous testing in environments that mirror production
   - User acceptance verification
   - Final optimizations and performance tuning

If a project can't fit within this nine-week framework, we don't take it on. Not because we lack the capability, but because we've learned that projects extending beyond this timeframe tend to suffer from scope creep, changing requirements, and diminishing returns.
