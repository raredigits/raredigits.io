## Your Software Doesn't Matter

We have a confession to make: we don't particularly care what software you're currently using.

Shocking, right? In an industry where vendors typically start conversations with "You need to replace everything you have with our superior platform," we're taking the radical position that your existing tools—even if they're just Google Sheets—are probably fine.

## The Integration Obsession

The software world is obsessed with integrations. "Does it integrate with Salesforce? Does it integrate with HubSpot? Does it integrate with the obscure industry-specific platform your company adopted in 2007 and now can't escape from?" These questions dominate software discussions as if the ability to automatically push data from one place to another is the pinnacle of technological achievement.

Here's our hot take: 
<div class="highlight">the specific integration matters less than what you're trying to learn from the data.</div>

Here's the truth: some of the most successful businesses we work with rely heavily on spreadsheets. Why? Because spreadsheets are incredibly flexible tools that adapt to how businesses actually work, rather than forcing businesses to adapt to the software.

If your Google Sheet contains the data we need to help you make better decisions, we're perfectly happy to work with it. We'd rather have good data in a simple tool than garbage data in an expensive platform.

## Send Us Your Finance People, Not Your Marketers

When we talk about integrations, we need to talk to the right people. And by "right people," we mean the people who understand your financial data—not your marketing team, not your sales manager, and definitely not your social media specialist (sorry).

We need the people who can tell us:
- Where the money actually comes from
- Where it actually goes
- What financial questions keep you up at night
- Which metrics actually drive your business decisions

This is usually your CFO, your controller, your accountant, or whoever is responsible for reporting financial results to your leadership team.

## Integration Is a Means, Not an End

Our approach to integration focuses on outcomes rather than processes:

1. We figure out what financial questions you need answered
2. We identify where that data currently lives
3. We build connections to extract, transform, and analyze that data
4. We present it in ways that drive better decision-making

Notice that "replacing your current systems" doesn't appear on this list. If your existing tools are serving your business, we'll work with them. Our goal is to enhance what you have, not disrupt your operations with unnecessary technology changes.

## The Pearl Diver Approach

Are we integration experts? Absolutely. We can connect to just about any system you're using. But our expertise isn't in the technical connections—it's in knowing which connections actually matter for your business.

So bring us your whoever understands the money. We'll figure out the rest, whether you're using state-of-the-art enterprise platforms or a collection of Google Sheets held together with formulas and determination.

Because at the end of the day, what matters isn't the sophistication of your tools, but the quality of the decisions they help you make.
