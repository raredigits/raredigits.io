## Investment in Sanity

We believe that selling software is like selling hammers when what you really need is a house. That's why we don't sell software—we sell outcomes, competencies, and fewer sleepless nights for your financial team.

Our pricing philosophy combines two approaches:

**Time & Materials** — For preparation, integration, and development work, we quote hourly rates. Don't worry, our developers work faster than your accounting department can approve invoices.

**License-Based** — Once everything is up and running, you pay for licenses based on which members of our digital "family" you want working for you.

## Meet the Family
We've organized our products into a hierarchy that would make organizational psychologists proud. Each level builds on the previous one, adding capabilities that incrementally transform your business from "where did all the money go?" to "we should probably buy a bigger safe."
