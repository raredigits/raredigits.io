In what financial analysts are calling "the least unnecessary software launch of the decade," Rare Digits has released [Corsair HQ](/tools/corsair/), a revolutionary executive intelligence platform designed for business leaders who are tired of pretending they understand their own company's reports.

## When Every Department Is Profitable But The Company Isn't

Corsair HQ addresses the fundamental paradox of modern business: how seventeen browser tabs of "business intelligence" can result in precisely zero actual intelligence about your business. The platform integrates with your existing ERP, CRM, and accounting systems to provide what executives have secretly wanted all alongâ€”a single screen that actually answers the question "how is my business doing?" without requiring an advanced degree in creative data interpretation.

"We noticed executives spending more time reconciling contradictory reports than making actual decisions," said the Rare Digits product team. "Corsair HQ is our solution to the problem of having more data but less clarity, more systems but fewer answers."

## The Executive Dashboard That Requires Just One Eye

Unlike traditional business intelligence tools that promise "360-degree visibility" while delivering 360 different metrics that don't connect to each other, Corsair HQ takes a refreshingly subversive approach. The platform filters the data tsunami down to what actually matters, connects information that should have been connected all along, and highlights problems before they become financial cardiac events.

For a complete breakdown of how Corsair HQ works and why it was named after privateers who raided valuable treasures while leaving the ballast behind, [visit the product description page](/tools/corsair/).

## Compatible With Your Existing Expensive Mistakes

Business leaders will be relieved to know that Corsair HQ works seamlessly with all major cloud solutions. This means you won't have to explain to your board why the systems you've already invested millions in were poorly chosen. Your teams keep using their familiar tools, you gain unprecedented clarity, and everyone maintains the fiction that all previous technology decisions were sound.

Early adopters report a 73% reduction in "staring blankly at conflicting spreadsheets" and an 86% decrease in "pretending to understand what these numbers mean."

## Available Now For Businesses Ready For Actual Clarity

Corsair HQ is available immediately for businesses that have grown tired of the "throw more dashboards at the problem" approach to financial visibility. For more information or to schedule a demonstration where we show you what your business is actually doing rather than what your department heads say it's doing, contact the Rare Digits team today.

Remember: in the world of business intelligence, the ability to see clearly with one eye is worth more than being blind with two.
