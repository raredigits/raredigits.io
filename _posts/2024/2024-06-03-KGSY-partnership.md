## Chinese Manufacturing Giant Selects Rare Digits

We're excited to announce that [Intelligent Technologies](https://www.chinakgsy.com), the Chinese industrial powerhouse moving an impressive 50,000 tons of product annually, has chosen Rare Digits to revolutionize their data management systems.

## Smart Choice for Massive Operations

When your production volumes can be measured in tens of thousands of tons, the data generated by your operations becomes similarly massive. Intelligent Technologies didn't build their manufacturing empire by making uninformed decisions, which is precisely why they've selected our solutions to bring clarity to their extensive operations.

## The Weight of Decision

50,000 tons of annual production creates:
- Complex supply chain data spanning multiple countries
- Production metrics from dozens of manufacturing lines
- Inventory management challenges at industrial scale
- Quality control data requiring immediate analysis

With volumes this substantial, efficiency isn't just desirable—it's essential for survival. That's why Intelligent Technologies' decision to partner with the most effective data management contractor makes perfect business sense.

## Data Efficiency at Industrial Scale

In manufacturing, efficiency on the factory floor must be matched by efficiency in the boardroom. When decision-makers at Intelligent Technologies evaluated potential data partners, they weren't looking for flashy presentations—they were seeking tangible results.

Their selection of Rare Digits confirms our approach:

## Data In, Meaning Out (Across Continents)

Our philosophy of transforming raw data into meaningful insights works in any language or business environment. For Intelligent Technologies, this means their vast production data will now power equally powerful business intelligence, helping them optimize every aspect of their operation.

We're looking forward to demonstrating how our "[Pure Performance, No Excess](/about/value/)" approach applies perfectly to their industrial-scale challenges.

This partnership represents another significant step in Rare Digits' expansion into international markets. Stay tuned for more news about how we're helping global enterprises transform their data into actionable insights.
