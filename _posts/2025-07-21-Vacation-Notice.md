One weird thing about running a company is that everyone expects you to, you know, actually work. But here’s the thing: we’ve decided that August 2025 is going to be our collective “nope” month.

Starting August 4th through September 8th, the entire Rare Digits Production team will be doing that thing humans supposedly do when they’re not staring at screens—relaxing, allegedly. (They’re told this involves activities like “touching grass” and “remembering what the sun feels like,” though skepticism remains.)

Now, you might wonder: “What about all our urgent requests and burning questions about data visualization philosophy?” Great question. Here’s where it gets interesting: our technical support will continue operating in normal mode, because apparently some people drew the short straw in the vacation lottery. (Just kidding—they volunteered. We think.)

This creates a fascinating corporate paradox: a company that’s simultaneously closed and open, like Schrödinger’s business entity. Our support team will handle your technical issues with the same efficiency as always, while the rest of us practice the ancient art of “logging off.”

Why announce this? Because transparency is good, and also because we learned that people get really upset when their emails bounce back with mysterious auto-replies. Who knew?

We’ll be back September 8th, presumably well-rested and with renewed enthusiasm for turning data chaos into decision clarity. Or at least with better tans.

Technical support remains available at [support@raredigits.io](support@raredigits.io). They promise to answer faster than we usually respond to Slack.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
