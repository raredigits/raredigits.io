## Follow the Money Across the Web3 Wilderness

Rare Digits has just launched Watchtower, our new application that monitors liquidity movements between Web3 networks. Think of it as a financial traffic helicopter reporting on capital flows across the increasingly congested blockchain highway system.

## What It Does

Watchtower tracks capital movements across blockchain networks, providing developers and investors with real-time intelligence on where the money's going. Because in the world of Web3, following the liquidity is like tracking migrating wildebeests—it tells you where the ecosystem is heading next.

## Who It's For

- **Developers**: Who need to know which ecosystems are gaining traction
- **Investors**: Looking to spot capital flow trends before they become obvious
- **Anyone**: Who enjoys watching money move around while pretending to work

## Current Capabilities

The first version supports EVM-compatible networks and Cosmos SDK chains—covering most of the territories where digital money does its nomadic wandering. Like any respectable financial surveillance tool, Watchtower plans to expand its jurisdiction in future updates.

## Why This Matters

In traditional finance, capital flows are obscured by private banking systems and offshore structures designed by people who consider sunlight a regulatory burden. In Web3, all transactions are public—but scattered across dozens of networks with different standards and interfaces.

Watchtower brings clarity to this chaos. Because making informed decisions requires actual information, not just Discord rumors and Twitter speculation.
