## AI butler promises to end the eternal suffering of executives who can’t find last quarter’s numbers without summoning three analysts and a data scientist

*Dubai, 09/04/2025* — In what can only be described as “finally,” the company today announced [Jeeves GPT](/tools/jeeves/), an AI-powered business intelligence platform that lets C-suite executives ask their ERP systems questions in actual human language instead of whatever ritualistic incantations they were using before.

The new system officially replaces the now-deceased Concierge App, which apparently had about as much conversational ability as a particularly stubborn spreadsheet. Jeeves GPT, powered by the latest large language models (because of course it is), promises to transform the age-old executive tradition of asking “What were our Q3 numbers again?” into something slightly less painful for everyone involved.

“We watched executives spend hours hunting for information that was literally sitting in their systems, ” said Rare's business analitycs, probably while gesturing dramatically at a Excel table nobody understands. “It’s 2025. Your phone can compose poetry about your lunch, but getting a simple revenue breakdown still required sending emails to Gary in Finance and waiting three business days.”

## The Rise and Fall of Spreadsheet Culture

Let’s be honest: spreadsheets are where good data goes to die. Sure, they look impressive with all those colorful charts and real-time widgets, but when was the last time anyone actually *used* one to make a decision? Mostly they just sit there looking busy while executives ask their assistants to “please get someone to pull the actual numbers.”

Jeeves GPT takes a different approach:

<div class="highlight">It lets you ask questions like a normal human being. </div>

Want to know if your new sales team is worth the ridiculous salaries you’re paying them? Just ask. Curious about whether that supply chain “disruption” everyone keeps mentioning is actually affecting your business? Jeeves has opinions, and more importantly, data to back them up.

The system gets particularly chatty when integrated with the company’s other products, Atlas ERP and Corsair HQ.

## AI That Actually Learns (Revolutionary, We Know)

Here’s where things get interesting: Jeeves GPT doesn’t just regurgitate pre-programmed responses like some kind of overpriced Magic 8-Ball. It actually learns from how your company works, what questions you ask, and probably what you had for breakfast (okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea).

“The old Concierge App was like having a very polite but pretty limited assistant, ” explained Dmitry Schnellreich, the COO of Rare Digits, presumably while suppressing traumatic memories of user training sessions. “Jeeves GPT is more like having a very smart, slightly sarcastic analyst who never sleeps and doesn’t judge you for asking the same question three different ways.”

The learning aspect means the system gets better at understanding your specific brand of corporate chaos. It picks up on industry jargon, learns which metrics actually matter to your business (as opposed to the seventeen KPIs someone insisted on tracking), and starts anticipating the follow-up questions you’re inevitably going to ask.

## The Board Meeting Revolution

Early users report that Jeeves GPT has fundamentally altered the pre-board meeting panic ritual. You know the one: frantic emails, last-minute PowerPoint edits, and that special kind of anxiety that comes from knowing someone’s definitely going to ask about something you forgot to check.

Now, apparently, executives can just casually ask their AI buddy for a competitive analysis while walking to the conference room. Revolutionary? Maybe. Slightly terrifying for anyone whose job involved manually compiling those reports? Definitely.

“I used to spend entire afternoons preparing for investor calls,” said one early adopter who clearly has better things to do with their time. “Now I just ask Jeeves for a rundown while I’m getting my coffee. It’s honestly a little unsettling how good it is.”

## The Future Is Conversational (And Probably Judging Your Decisions)

Rare Digits promises that Jeeves GPT will keep getting smarter as AI technology advances, which means your business intelligence is basically investing in its own education. Whether that’s reassuring or vaguely dystopian depends on your relationship with technology and/or science fiction movies.

What’s clear is that the era of hunting through endless dashboards and waiting for analysts to compile reports is officially over. Whether that’s progress or just another way to make everyone’s job slightly more complicated remains to be seen, but at least now you can get your quarterly numbers without having to remember which tab has the “real” revenue data.

[Jeeves GPT](/tools/jeeves/) is available now for enterprise clients who are tired of pretending they understand their current business intelligence setup and ready to try talking to their data like a normal person.
