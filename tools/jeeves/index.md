## Your Data Speaks When You Need It Most

C-level executives waste 40% of their time hunting for information that already exists in their systems. Board meetings get delayed because someone needs “just five more minutes” to pull that one critical report. Strategic decisions hang in limbo while analysts scramble through databases.

We built Jeeves GPT because waiting for answers is expensive, and complicated interfaces are insulting to intelligent people.

This isn’t another chatbot throwing generic responses at your questions. Jeeves GPT connects directly to your ERP system and transforms years of business data into conversational intelligence. Ask it anything about your company’s performance, and get the kind of nuanced, contextual answers that would normally require a team of analysts and three days of prep time.

## When Minutes Matter More Than Presentations

Picture this: you’re walking into a board meeting and a shareholder asks about Q3 performance in the Eastern region compared to projections. Instead of promising to follow up later, you pull out your phone and ask Jeeves. Within seconds, you have profit margins, variance analysis, and the three key factors driving the deviation. The conversation continues, decisions get made, momentum builds.

Take a look:

                    <strong>Revenue:</strong> $12.4M vs $11.8M target (+5.1% ahead)<br>
                    <strong>Gross Margin:</strong> 68.2% vs 65% target<br>
                    <strong>EBITDA:</strong> $3.2M vs $2.9M target<br><br>
                    You're tracking ahead in all key metrics. The revenue outperformance is driven primarily by your Enterprise segment (+18% vs plan) and strong performance in the Northern region. However, I notice some headwinds in customer acquisition costs that we should discuss.

Or consider quarterly planning sessions that used to eat entire afternoons. Now you can explore different scenarios in real-time: “What happens to our cash flow if we delay the Manchester expansion by two months?” The answer comes with detailed projections and risk assessments, not vague promises to “run the numbers.”

When your investor calls asking about ROI on last year’s technology investments, you don’t need to scramble through spreadsheets or wait for your CFO to compile a report. Jeeves delivers comprehensive analysis instantly, complete with comparisons to industry benchmarks and recommendations for optimization.

## Intelligence That Scales With Your Ambition

The real power emerges when Jeeves GPT works alongside Atlas ERP and Corsair HQ. This isn’t just integration—it’s transformation. Your entire data ecosystem becomes conversational. Financial models, operational metrics, and strategic forecasts flow together in natural dialogue.

Imagine having a senior analyst who never sleeps, never misunderstands context, and never says “I’ll get back to you on that.” Someone who can simultaneously track your sales pipeline, monitor supply chain risks, and calculate the impact of currency fluctuations on your European operations.

That’s what intelligent systems feel like when they’re built right.

## Beyond Dashboards, Beyond Waiting

Jeeves GPT doesn’t just answer questions—it anticipates the conversations that matter. It understands that when you ask about monthly revenue, you probably also want to know about seasonal trends and upcoming risks. When you inquire about team performance, it contextualizes the numbers within market conditions and strategic objectives.

Top executives using Jeeves GPT report saving over five hours per week on information gathering alone. More importantly, they’re making faster, more informed decisions because the friction between question and insight has virtually disappeared.

Your time is finite. Your data shouldn’t keep you waiting.

Decisions happen at the speed of conversation.
