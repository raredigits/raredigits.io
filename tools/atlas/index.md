# Atlas ERP

Current version: v.2.4.6

Atlas ERP is what happens when engineers who actually run businesses get fed up with traditional ERP interfaces designed by people who clearly never had to use them under deadline pressure.

We took [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com)—one of the most powerful open-source ERP platforms available—and performed radical interface surgery.

The result? An ERP that doesn't require a PhD in menu navigation to find critical information.

## What Makes Atlas Different:

## Key Features

- **Deliberately Customized Odoo Core**: We kept what works and fixed what doesn't
- **Proprietary Enhancement Modules**: Added capabilities that real businesses need but standard ERPs mysteriously omit
- **Interface Detox**: Ruthlessly eliminated UI clutter to surface what actually matters for decision-making
- **Client-Specific Adaptability**: Easily conforms to your unique business processes without turning into a custom development nightmare

Atlas ERP doesn't just manage your business data—it makes that data usable by the humans who need to make actual decisions with it. Revolutionary concept, we know.
