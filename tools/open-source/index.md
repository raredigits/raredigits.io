One thing about software development is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;involves writing a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;code. Another thing about writing a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;code is&nbsp;that you probably shouldn&#146;t write all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;from scratch every time. That would be&nbsp;like reinventing double-entry bookkeeping for each new business venture&nbsp;&#151; technically possible, sure, but there&#146;s a&nbsp;reason accountants don&#146;t start by&nbsp;debating the metaphysical nature of&nbsp;debits and credits with each new client.


So&nbsp;here are some tools you might find useful. They&#146;re all on&nbsp;GitHub under MIT licenses, which means you can use them without calling your lawyer, a&nbsp;rare pleasure in&nbsp;modern business life:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 mobile:grid-cols-1 gap-md padding-b-lg">
    <div class="col-span-1 card shadow-sm padding-lg">
        <p><a href="https://raredigits.art">Rare Styles</a>: A&nbsp;style library for rapid development, for those moments when you need a&nbsp;button that looks like a&nbsp;button before your next funding round closes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-1 card shadow-sm padding-lg">
        <p><a href="">11ty Scripts Collection</a>: for simple websites, because sometimes you just need something that works without explaining to&nbsp;your CEO what &ldquo;static site generation&rdquo; means while they glance anxiously at&nbsp;their watch.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-1 card shadow-sm padding-lg">
        <p><a href="">Pontivox</a>: A&nbsp;free feedback server, since collecting user opinions should be&nbsp;easier than collecting on&nbsp;accounts receivable from that one client. You know the one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-1 card shadow-sm padding-lg">
        <p><a href="">BookKeeper</a>: Zoho Books synchronization script, which solves a&nbsp;problem you probably didn&#146;t know you had until tax season arrived and suddenly became the most important problem in&nbsp;your professional life.</p>

Feel free to&nbsp;use these. Contribute if&nbsp;you&#146;d like. The nice thing about open-source tools is&nbsp;that unlike most financial instruments, their value tends to&nbsp;increase the more people use them, without requiring a&nbsp;single roadshow presentation or&nbsp;term sheet.
